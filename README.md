# Blue Team Notes
A collection of one-liners useful for blue team work. Tend to be Powershell. I've generally used these  one liners on [Velociraptor](https://www.velocidex.com)
, which lets me query a thousand endpoints at once.

I use _sysmon_ and _memetask_ as file or directory names in lieu of real file names, just replace the stupid names I've given with the files you actually need. Sorry if I blur anything, but opsec and all that.

I've included screenshots where possible so you know what you're getting. Some screenshots will be from a Win machine, others may be from the Velociraptor GUI but they do the same thing as if you were on a host's powershell command line.

## Contact me
If you see a mistake, or have an easier way to run a command then you're welcome to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Purp1eW0lf) or commit an issue here. 

If you want to contribute I'd be grateful for the command and a screenshot. I'll of course add you as a contributor

# Shell Style
### Give shell timestamp
For screenshots during IR, I like to have the date, time, and timezone in my shell
#### CMD
```bat
setx prompt $D$S$T$H$H$H$S$B$S$P$_--$g
:: all the H's are to backspace the stupid microsecond timestamp
:: $_ and --$g seperate the date/time and path from the actual shell
:: We make the use of the prompt command: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/prompt
:: setx is in fact the command line command to write variables to the registery
:: We are writing the prompt's new timestamp value in the cmd line into the reg so it stays, otherwise it would not stay in the cmdline when we closed it.
```

#### Pwsh
```powershell
###create a powershell profile, if it doesnt exist already
New-Item $Profile -ItemType file â€“Force
##open it in notepad to edit
function prompt{ "[$(Get-Date)]" +" | PS "+ "$(Get-Location) > "}
##risky move, need to tighten this up. Change your execution policy or it won't
#run the profile ps1
#run as powershell admin
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

#### Bash
```bash
##open .bashrc
sudo nano .bashrc

# Powershell
## OSInfo
### Get OS and Pwsh info
```powershell
$Bit = (get-wmiobject Win32_OperatingSystem).OSArchitecture ; $V = $host | select-object -property "Version" ; 
$Build = (Get-WmiObject -class Win32_OperatingSystem).Caption ; 
write-host "$env:computername is a $Bit $Build with Pwsh $V
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119976027-75699300-bfae-11eb-8baa-42f9bbccbce2.png)ries

## Network Queries
### Find internet established connections, and sort by time established
You can always sort by whatever value you want really. CreationTime is just an example
```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -AppliedSetting Internet |
select-object -property remoteaddress, remoteport, creationtime |
Sort-Object -Property creationtime |
format-table -autosize
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/120002550-dacc7c80-bfcc-11eb-95f5-1743307a55c4.png)

### Sort remote IP connections, and then unique them
This really makes strange IPs stand out....may show some C2 call back addresses if lucky. 
```
(Get-NetTCPConnection).remoteaddress | Sort-Object -Unique 
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/120003762-f1bf9e80-bfcd-11eb-9bf7-bcf487f032d6.png)

#### Hone in on a suspicious IP
If you see suspicious IP address in any of the above, then I would hone in on it
```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection |
? {($_.RemoteAddress -eq "1.52.93.4")} |
select-object -property state, creationtime, localport,remoteport
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/120005113-7101a200-bfcf-11eb-8ae4-673c27d01eb8.png)

## Process Queries

### Get specific info about the full path binary that a process is running
```powershell
get-process -name "memetask" | select-object -property Name, Id, Path
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119979341-bb285a80-bfb2-11eb-89a8-83b4c8f732c5.png)

### Is a specific process a running on a machine or not
```powershell
if (get-process | select-object -property ProcessName | where-object {$_.ProcessName -Match "memes"})
{Write-Host "memes successfully installed on " -NoNewline ; hostname} 
else {write-host "memes absent from " -NoNewline ; hostname}
```
Example of process that is absent
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119976215-b1045d00-bfae-11eb-806c-49a62f5aab15.png)
Example of process that is present
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119976374-ea3ccd00-bfae-11eb-94cd-37ed4233564d.png)

### Get process hash
Great to make malicious process stand out. If you want a different alogrithmn, just change it after `-Algorithmn` to something like `sha256` 
```powershell
foreach ($proc in Get-Process | select path -Unique)
{try { Get-FileHash $proc.path -Algorithm md5 -ErrorAction stop | Select-Object -property hash,path}catch{}}
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119976802-8cf54b80-bfaf-11eb-82de-1a92bbcae4f9.png)

### Show all DLLs loaded with a process
```powershell
get-process -name "memestask" -module 
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119976958-bdd58080-bfaf-11eb-8833-7fdf78045967.png)

Alternatively, pipe `|fl` and it will give a granularity to the DLLs

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119977057-db0a4f00-bfaf-11eb-97ce-1e762088de8e.png)

### Identify process CPU usage 
```powershell
 (Get-Process -name "googleupdate").CPU | fl 
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119982198-756d9100-bfb6-11eb-8645-e41cf46116b3.png)

I get mixed results with this command but it's supposed to give the percent of CPU usage.
```powershell
$ProcessName = "symon" ; $ProcessName = (Get-Process -Id $ProcessPID).Name; $CpuCores = (Get-WMIObject Win32_ComputerSystem).NumberOfLogicalProcessors; $Samples = (Get-Counter "\Process($Processname*)\% Processor Time").CounterSamples; $Samples | Select `InstanceName,@{Name="CPU %";Expression={[Decimal]::Round(($_.CookedValue / $CpuCores), 2)}}
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119982326-9a620400-bfb6-11eb-9a66-ad5a5661bc8a.png)

## Sch Task Queries
### To find the commands a task is running
Identify the user behind a command. Great at catching out malicious schtasks that perhaps are imitating names, or a process name
```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask | Select-Object -Property TaskName,author | fl 
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119978821-01c98500-bfb2-11eb-9149-fc1a96a1af87.png)

Great one liner to find exactly WHAT a regular task is doing
```powershell
$task = Get-ScheduledTask | where TaskName -EQ "meme task"; 
$task.Actions
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119979087-5f5dd180-bfb2-11eb-9d4d-bbbf66043535.png)

To stop the task
```powershell
Get-ScheduledTask "memetask" | Stop-ScheduledTask
```

## File Queries
### Check if a specific file or path is alive. 

I've found that this is a great one to quickly check for specific vulnerabilities. Take for example, CVE-2021-21551. The one below this one is an excellent way of utilising the 'true/false' binary results that test-path can give
``` powershell
test-path -path "C:\windows\temp\DBUtil_2_3.Sys"
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119982761-283def00-bfb7-11eb-83ab-061b6c628372.png)

### test if  files and directories are present or absent
This is great to just sanity check if things exist. Great when you're trying to check if files or directories have been left behind when you're cleaning stuff up.
```powershell
$a = Test-Path C:\windows\sysmon.exe; $b= Test-Path "C:\Windows\SysmonDrv.sys"; $c = test-path "C:\Program Files (x86)\sysmon"; $d = test-path "C:\Program Files\sysmon"; 
$env:computername; 
IF ($a -eq 'True') {Write-Host "C:\windows\sysmon.exe present"} ELSE {Write-Host "C:\windows\sysmon.exe absent"}; 
IF ($b -eq 'True') {Write-Host "C:\Windows\SysmonDrv.sys present"} ELSE {Write-Host "C:\Windows\SysmonDrv.sys absent"} ; 
IF ($c -eq 'True') {Write-Host "C:\Program Files (x86)\sysmon present"} ELSE {Write-Host "C:\Program Files (x86)\sysmon absent"}; 
IF ($d -eq 'True') {Write-Host "C:\Program Files\sysmon present"} ELSE {Write-Host "C:\Program Files\sysmon absent"}
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119979754-443f9180-bfb3-11eb-9259-5409a0d98c04.png)

You can use `test-path` to query Registry, but even the 2007 [Microsoft docs say](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/test-path-we-goofed/) that this can give inconsistent results, so I wouldn't bother with test-path for reg stuff when it's during an IR

### Recursively look for particular file types, and once you find the files get their hashes
This one-liner was a godsend during the Microsoft Exchange ballache back in early 2021
```powershell
Get-ChildItem -path "C:\windows\temp" -Recurse -Force -File -Include *.aspx, *.js, *.zip| Get-FileHash | Select-Object -property hash, path
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119977578-887d6280-bfb0-11eb-9e56-fad64296128f.png)

Here's the a bash alternative
```bash
find . type f -exec sha256sum {} \; 2> /dev/null | grep -Ei 'asp|js' | sort
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119977935-e7db7280-bfb0-11eb-8ee0-4da29089c736.png)

## Reg Queries

#### Show reg keys
```powershell
##show all reg keys
(Gci -Path Registry::).name

##lets take HKEY_CURRENT_USER as a subkey example. Let's see the entries in this subkey
(Gci -Path HKCU:\).name

# If you want to absolutely fuck your life up, you can list the names recursively....will take forever though
(Gci -Path HKCU:\ -recurse).name
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119998273-75768c80-bfc8-11eb-869a-807a140d7a52.png)


#### Read a reg entry
```powershell
 Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SysmonDrv"
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119994436-832a1300-bfc4-11eb-98cb-b4148413ac97.png)

#### Remove a reg entry
If there's a malicious reg entry, you can remove it this way
```powershell
# Read the reg to make sure this is the bad boy you want
get-itemproperty -Path 'HKCU:\Keyboard Layout\Preload\'
#remove it by piping it to remove-item
get-itemproperty -Path 'HKCU:\Keyboard Layout\Preload\' | Remove-Item -force
# double check it's gone by trying to re-read it
get-itemproperty -Path 'HKCU:\Keyboard Layout\Preload\'
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119999624-d8b4ee80-bfc9-11eb-9770-5ec6e78f9714.png)


## WEF & WEC Troubleshooting 
I've tended to use these commands to troubleshoot Windows Event Forwarding and other log related stuff
#### Overview of what the sysmon/operational log is up to
```powershell
Get-WinEvent -ListLog Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | Format-List -Property * 
```
#### Specifically get the last time sysmon log was written to
```powershell
(Get-WinEvent -ListLog Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational).lastwritetime 
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119979946-81a41f00-bfb3-11eb-8bc0-f2e893440b18.png)

#### Compare last sysmon log written date to X day ago
Checks if the date was written recently, and if so, just print _sysmon working_ if not recent, then print the date last written. I've found sometimes that sometimes sysmon bugs out on a machine, and stops committing to logs. Change the number after `-ge` to be more flexible than the one day it currently compares to

```powershell
$b = (Get-WinEvent -ListLog Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational).lastwritetime; 
$a = Get-WinEvent -ListLog Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational | where-object {(new-timespan $_.LastWriteTime).days -ge 1}; 
if ($a -eq $null){Write-host "sysmon_working"} else {Write-host "$env:computername $b"}
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119979908-72bd6c80-bfb3-11eb-9bff-856ebcc01375.png)

#### WinRM & WECSVC permissions
Test the permissions of winrm - used to see windows event forwarding working, which uses winrm usually on endpoints and wecsvc account on servers
```cmd
netsh http show urlacl url=http://+:5985/wsman/ && netsh http show urlacl url=https://+:5986/wsman/
``` 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119980070-ae583680-bfb3-11eb-8da7-51d7e5393599.png)

## Code Red
### Disconnect network adaptor, firewall the fuck out of an endpoint, and display warning box
This is a code-red command. Used to isolate a machine in an emergency.
Will isolate a machine and display a warning box. 
In the penultimate and final line, you can change the text and title that will pop up for the user
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block all outbound traffic" -Direction Outbound -Action Block | out-null; 
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block all inbound traffic" -Direction Inbound -Action Block | out-null; 
$adapter = Get-NetAdapter|foreach { $_.Name } ; Disable-NetAdapter -Name "$adapter" -Confirm:$false; 
Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationCore,PresentationFramework; 
[System.Windows.MessageBox]::Show('Your Computer has been Disconnected from the Internet for Security Issues. Please do not try to re-connect to the internet. Contact Security Helpdesk Desk ',' CompanyNameHere Security Alert',[System.Windows.MessageBoxButton]::OK,[System.Windows.MessageBoxImage]::Information)
```

# Linux
This section is a bit dry, forgive me. My Bash DFIR tends to be a lot more spontaneous and therefore I don't write them down as much as I do the Pwsh one-liners

## Bash History
Checkout the SANS DFIR talk by Half Pomeraz called [You don't know jack about .bash_history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wv1xqOV2RyE). It's a terrifying insight into how weak bash history really is by default

#### Add add timestamps to `.bash_history`
Via .bashrc
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
#at the bottom
export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%d/%m/%y %T '
#expand bash history size too

#save and exit
source ~/.bashrc
```
Or by /etc/profile
```bash
nano /etc/profile
export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%d/%m/%y %T '

#save and exit
source /etc/profile
```

Then run the `history` command to see your timestamped bash history

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119987113-9507b800-bfbc-11eb-8033-064c37f5fe26.png)

## Grep and Ack
#### Grep Regex extract IPv4
```bash
grep -E -o "(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)" file.txt | sort | uniq 
```
#### Use Ack to highlight!
One thing I really like about Ack is that it can highlight words easily, which is great for screenshots and reporting. So take the above example, let's say we're looking for two specific IP, we can have ack filter and highlight those

[Ack](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ack) is like Grep's younger, more refined brother. Has some of greps' flags as default, and just makes life a bit easier.

```bash
#install ack if you need to: sudo apt-get install ack
ack -i '159.89.95.163|86.105.18.116' *
```

## Rapid Malware Analaysis
### Capa
[Capa](https://github.com/fireeye/capa) is a great tool to quickly examine wtf a binary does. This tool is great, it previously helped me identify a keylogger that was pretending to be an update.exe for a program
Usage
```bash
./capa malware.exe > malware.txt
# I tend to do normal run and then verbose
./capa -vv malware.exe >> malware.txt
cat malware.txt
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/119991809-c1720300-bfc1-11eb-8409-6523a9b0019b.png)

Example of Capa output for the keylogger

## Processes and Networks
### Track parent-child processes easier
```bash
ps -aux --forest
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/120000069-54af3680-bfca-11eb-91a8-221562914878.png)

#### Get a quick overview of network activity
```bash
netstat -plunt
#if you don't have netstat, try ss
ss -plunt
```
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44196051/120000196-79a3a980-bfca-11eb-89ed-bbc87b4ca0bc.png)
